# React `useState` and `useEffect` Hooks

Better understand the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks in React.  
These notes are designed to explain both the conceptual and practical usage of these hooks.
---

What Iâ€™ve Understood About useState:

# useState Hook
- We use a destructured array to get two arguments:  
    the first is the state itself, and the second is the function used to update the state dynamically in the app.  
    Syntax:
  ```
  const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
  ```

- useState is used to enable React components to manage and respond to state changes.
- React components by default render static HTML elements, but with useState, they can re-render dynamically upon user interactions.
- **Without useState**, there would be no way to trigger re-renders or track changes in data (e.g., form inputs, button clicks, or API responses).
  
- **Note**: You can use useState not only for primitive types (like strings, and numbers) but also for complex types, such as arrays or objects.
- For example:
``` const [userData, setUserData] = useState({ name: '', age: 0 }); ```

What Iâ€™ve Understood About useEffect:

# useEffect Hook

- The useEffect hook handles side effects (tasks that occur "outside" the main rendering logic of the component).
- Examples of side effects include:
  - Updating the DOM directly.
  - Fetching data from an API or database.
  - Managing timers or intervals.
  - Adding or removing event listeners.

- useEffect re-runs (re-renders) the component when the effect's dependencies in the state change.

**Arguments Passed to useEffect:**

- Function: Specifies the code logic for the side effect (what should happen during or after rendering).
- Dependency Array: A list that defines when the effect should run. Based on this array, useEffect has three use cases:
  - No Dependency Array: The effect runs after every render (including re-renders).
  - Empty Dependency Array: The effect runs only once when the component mounts.
  - Specific Dependencies: The effect runs whenever one or more dependencies in the array are updated.

# Cleanup Function:
- A cleanup function ensures resources are released properly and avoids issues like memory leaks.
- It helps keep the React Tree clean by handling the following:
  - Component Unmount: Cleans up resources like intervals, subscriptions, or event listeners when the component is removed from the DOM.
  - Effect Re-run: Cleans up before re-running the effect if dependencies change.

- For example, clean up for an interval:

```
  useEffect(() => {
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      console.log('Interval running...');
    }, 1000);
  
    return () => clearInterval(intervalId); // Cleanup
  }, []);
```
**Note**: While useEffect handles side effects, you can manage more complex async tasks (e.g., API calls) inside the function, using async/await for better readability:

# Notes on Best Practices
- Always use the dependency array properly in useEffect.
- Missing dependencies can cause bugs, and over-including them may lead to unnecessary renders.
- Use the cleanup function whenever your effect involves resources like intervals, subscriptions, or event listeners.
- Combine useState and useEffect for dynamic updates and robust side effect handling.


# Practical Examples
1. Using useState to Manage Form Input:
```
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const NameForm = () => {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={name}
        onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Enter your name"
      />
      <p>Your name is: {name}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default NameForm;
```
2. Using useEffect for Data Fetching:
``` 
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const DataFetcher = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
      const result = await response.json();
      setData(result);
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []); // Empty array: effect runs only once on mount

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map((item, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{item}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};

export default DataFetcher;

```
3. Dynamic Timer with Cleanup in useEffect:
```
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const Timer = () => {
  const [time, setTime] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      setTime((prevTime) => prevTime + 1);
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(intervalId); // Cleanup on unmount
  }, []);

  return <h1>Elapsed Time: {time}s</h1>;
};

export default Timer;
```
